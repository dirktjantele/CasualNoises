Following is a description of the protocol used for communication between the north side mcu and the south side mcu.

Data en control data is send back and forth between the two sides using SPI.
The north side mcu is the SPI master while the south side mcu is the SPI slave.
There are also three signal lines used to synchronise master and slave and manage the communication. 
These lines are:
- INTERCONN_A: Req - master->slave - request an SPI transaction
- INTERCONN_B: Ack - slave->master - acknowledge to indicate that the slave is ready to receive data
- INTERCONN_C: Data/Cmd - indicates what kind of data package is exchanged

Data/Cmd high: data is exchanged
Data/Cmd low : commands is exchenged

Data packets holds audio sample data while command packages only hold commands and are smaller, so faster
to exchange, than data packages.

Startup:

When starting up the master 'pings' the slave by toggeling the Data/Cmd line until the slave responses with
a ping on the Ack line. Regular communication can start now.

After communication is setup, the master sends a command package in order to obtain some info about the slave.
For now this is only used to test the communication between both sides...
